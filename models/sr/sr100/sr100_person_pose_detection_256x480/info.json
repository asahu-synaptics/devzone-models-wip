  "description": "The **Person Pose Detection 256x480** model developed by Synaptics, is a lightweight quantized `tflite` model developed for the **SR100 processor** in the Synaptics Astra\u2122  SR MCU Series. \n\nIt efficiently generates bounding boxes and identifies 17 keypoints for each person, corresponding to various body parts. Each keypoint is accompanied by a confidence score that indicates the reliability of the detection, enabling accurate estimation of the person's pose. This model can fit in Flash and designed to fit in SRAM as well.",
