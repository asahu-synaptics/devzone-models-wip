# PoseNet MobileNet 0.75 Quant

## Model Overview


A quantized PoseNet model using MobileNet architecture with 75% width multiplier for efficient and optimized body pose estimation.


The PoseNet MobileNet 0.75 Quant model  is developed and optimized for the Synaptics Astra™ **SL1680 processor** NPU and **SL1640 processor** NPU.

## Model Features
- **Model Type:** Pose Detection
- **Input Size:** various resolutions based on deployment
- **Output Size:** various resolutions based on deployment

> **ℹ️ INFO:** 
> This model is ready to use on Synaptics Astra Machina boards. An NPU optimized version of the PoseNet MobileNet 0.75 Quant is installed in the Astra SDK Image.


## Deployment on Synaptics Astra SL1600 Series 

This particular model is compiled for **Synaptics Astra SL1680** processor. You can find this model already pre-installed on Machina™ Dev kit with SL1680 processor. 

You can also find the same model compiled for **Synaptics Astra SL1640** processor pre-installed on Machina™ Dev kit with SL1640 processor.

Synaptics Astra Machina™ is Modular developer kit for Astra SL-Series of high-performance IoT processors with integrated Synaptics Veros™ wireless connectivity solution. Learn more [here](https://www.synaptics.com/products/embedded-processors/astra-machina-foundation-series)

### Application binary

The `synap_cli_od` command line application allows running object detection models like PoseNet MobileNet 0.75 Quant.

Inputs:

* The converted synap model (`.synap` extension)
* Optionally, a confidence threshold for detected objects
* One or more images (jpeg or png format)

Outputs:

* A list of detected objects for each input image, including:
  - Bounding box
  - Class index
  - Confidence score

Command line usage on Astra SL1680 and SL1640:

```
MODELS=/usr/share/synap/models/

cd $MODELS/object_detection/body_pose/model/posenet_mobilenet_075/posenet_mobilenet_075_quant

synap_cli_od -m model.synap input_image.jpg
```


Example output on SL1680:

```
Input image: input_image.jpg (w = 640, h = 480, c = 3)
Detection time: 2.32 ms
#   Score  Class  Position  Size     Description
0   0.95       0   94,193    62,143  person
```

> **ℹ️ INFO:**
> JPEG/PNG input images are resized in software to the network input tensor size. 


> **💡NOTE:**
> Ensure the output format is defined during model conversion. Missing format details can result in errors such as *"Failed to initialize detector"*.



## Performance on NPU 

| Processors      | Inference Time (ms) |
|-------------|--------------------|
| SL1680  | 2.32   |
| SL1640  | 4.13   |




## Optimize and Customize the model

Advanced users may wish to customize the source model and recompile it for the Synaptics Astra NPU.
